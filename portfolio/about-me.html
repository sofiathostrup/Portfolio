            <p class="column"> Hello, my name is Sofia, I am 25 years old and I am studying multimedia designer. I have through the last 6 years
                worked at Ikea as a storage worker, but as I can not see myself working in sales for the rest of my life I had to come up with something new. I have always loved creative subjects,
                and that's why I thought multimedia design
                would be something I could be very interested in. 
                My style is very much influenced by Vikings and by the old Nordic traditions, I have always been deep
                fascinated by the Asir, the old traditions and the old religion.
